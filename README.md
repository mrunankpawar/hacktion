# Mash-Mix 🎶

## Muse and remix your favourite music and showcase your creativity!

## Inspiration 💡
We all are so inclined toward music and we imagine if we could create something which will remix our favorite/ trending songs and have fun along with friends and family.

## What it does ❓
It plays the music when you click on the buttons or press the key allocated to it and you can remix it by clicking or pressing two or more keys together.

## How we built it 👨🏻‍💻
We built the project using HTML, CSS, Javascript and used Git and GitHub for collaboration

## Challenges we ran into ⚠️
The biggest challenge we faced was editing the sound clips and having it around 3-4 seconds. Also, it was a little challenging for us to add the animation to the button when pressed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
We are proud that we were able to create this fun webpage successfully and mostly proud that we were able to create this within such a short span of time.

## What we learned 🗒️
We learned a lot about Javascript and adding audio to websites, using the play() function, and many other things.

## What's next for Mash-Mix 🔮
We are looking forward to adding more content and also thinking of providing an option that can allow the user to download their Mash-Mix version.
